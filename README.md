# Agents
Sean Browning (NCEZID/OD Data Science Team)

## Background

I wanted to learn how to create and use language agents to solve complex problems. Langchain wasn't cutting it for me, so I made my own library from first principles.
Right now, everything is quite experimental and I'm still figuring out the API.

## Installation

Should be pip installable from this repo.

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/cdcai/agents.git
```

## Examples

#TODO
